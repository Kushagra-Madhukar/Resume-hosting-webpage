        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, My name is Kushagra Madhukar.</p>
        <p>I am currently a student pursuing my btech in civil engineering from NIT Bhopal. I have always been into computers and programming. My love for computers started with the usual MS paint expressing my creativity in it in the elementary school. Being a curious person I was fascinated by computers from the very start merely by the fact they make so many things possible which 100 years ago might have seem like magic. Later in life my fascination grew even more when I took Java as my optional subject in my secondary school. Seeing myself creating things and implementing them pushed me more towards software development. However, my score in JEE could't land me into CS branch of NITs or IITs.<br> During my college life I have explored my interests and all the other engineering branches and the more I have explored, the more I have been pulled towards Computers. The technology field has huge potential for research as well as engineering innovations varying from Machine Learning to Quantum computing which serves as a prime motivation for me to make a career in this field. Following the same path I have started with basic website development and will gradually move towards more advanced topics all the while mastering my problem solving and coding skills. This website marks the stepping stone for me into the world of software development. </p>
